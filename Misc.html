									<h1>Plague Game</h1>
									<p>This is a project that I did in my Sixth Form College for my Level 4 course. We made a game for a clients' exhibit.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/PlagueBackground.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Through East Norfolk Sixth Form college, we were tasked with working with the Time and Tide Museum so create a game for one of the featured exhibits that they had. 
								Myself and two others worked on creating a fun and easy childrens game for their Medieval Medicine exhibit. It can currently be played at the museum as long as the exhibit stays there.</p>
								<p> The general idea of the game is that the player must read the symptoms that can be seen on the right of the screen (as well as looking at the characters within the game as visual aids if they are stuck)
								 to decide whether or not the character has the plague. If the player is correct they earn a point, and can earn more through achieving combo points (by getting answers correct in multiples of fives)
								and also lose points through getting the answer wrong (it is possible to play the game from a different perspective and see how low you can get the score, since negative combos also exist!</p>
