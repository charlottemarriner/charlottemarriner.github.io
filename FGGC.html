									Semester 1</h1>
									<p>For semester one of my Further Games and Graphical Concepts module, we were required to implement a structured 3D environment, exploiting the programmable pipeline to render a range
									of lighting and shading models using an appropriate graphics API via an object-oriented approach. We were required to understand critically the mathematical operations underpinning
									comlex model manipulations used to implement physics-based and AI-based simulation models for computer games.

								<p>For the assignment, I was able to implement the loading of game assets, the rendering of game assets. I included a mixture of hard coded buffers, Obj loading, and loaded a mix of assets
								and rendered them to the screen. A depth buffer and wireframe mode were also implemented and can be toggled on and off. A basic ground plane was also drawn. Per pixel lighting was also fully 
								implemented. The user can do some linear and rotation control of a player controlled object (a pyramid) and texture mapping is implemented on an object with lighting and shading calculations
								(although this may not be entirely accurate). Static and top-down viewpoints are available.</p>

									<p>For semester two of my Further Games and Graphical Concepts module, we were required to produce an implementation of a mass-aggregate physics system, rigid body simulation, collision
									detection, collision response and add any additional features.

								<p>For the assignment I was able to implement a mass aggregate system, including velocity and acceleration using the appropriate formula, the applicaiton of a force accumulation model (including
								thrust, wind/drag force etc.), the addition of gravity and friction, and the inclusion of laminar and turbulent drag.</p>
