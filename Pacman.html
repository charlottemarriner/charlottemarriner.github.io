									<h1>Pacman Project</h1>
									<p>A project done in the first semester of the first year of Computer Games Programming at Staffordshire University</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Snowman.gif" alt="" /></div>
								<p>In the first semester of my Computer Games Programming course at Staffordshire University I completed a version of a Pacman game for
								one of my modules. Although it was not an exact remake of the game, and there isn't a traditional map, the player is able to progress through
								the game and its levels by collecting munchines (christmas lights) and getting bonus points by collecting the cherry (the wrapped present).</p>
								<p> When the player starts the game they are able to select between easy, medium and hard modes (these difficulties are depicted by providing the
								player with a differing number of enemies on the screen) by entering 1, 2 or 3 on the keyboard. This will then open the game window and allow the 
								player to start the game. Once the game has started, the player can collect christmas lights, presents and also die to enemies. The player can wrap
								around the screen and progress to the next level upon collecting a certain number of christmas lights. Once progressing to the next level, the enemies
								will get faster. </p>

								<p> The aim of this project was to create a version of Pacman for the first semester in the Fundamentals of Game and Graphical System Development (FOGGS) 
								module. This included following numerous tutorials, and then branching out and using knowledge from other modules and the FOGGS module to add additional 
								features to the game to make it either more unique, or more like the original Pacman game. This was important to introduce students to both the basics of 
								C++ and looking into programming a 2D game using the S2D library. </p>
								<p> During this project, several tutorials were followed detailing: an introduction to the Pacman Framework, creating menus, 2D animation, prototypes, 
								functions and parameters, structures, arrays, user input, artificial intelligence (AI), dynamic memory and references. In order to add additional features
								 into the game, it was required to look deeper into the subject and look at how other people had done specific things with their own games. Most interesting 
								were the ways that people had done their own AI as well as made their own maps, although for someone with little programming knowledge within C++ or similar 
								languages, this would likely appear rather daunting. </p>
								<p>  Since the project was something new, and likely the first time anyone had ever done this much within programming, it was very challenging. Even adding 
								the most basic of features to the game, proved to be incredibly frustrating to add, although it did help to understand more about how certain features of programming
								 in C++ works (namely pointers, references, functions and classes). Although the game seems very basic and barebones, a lot of research was put into attempting to add
								 additional features to the game. Some of them made it into the final product, others were just too challenging to try to add or just provided many errors deemed personally
								 unsolvable. </p>
								<p> To conclude, the project itself was extremely challenging, although it was a highly useful learning experience that can be applied to the GEC (Games Engine Creation) module
								 next semester. The game itself appears very bare bones, although how the theme itself and some other aspects of the game turned out has been rather pleasing. The 
								attempt of adding a map to the game proved to be the biggest challenge, namely because it wasn’t in the final product. Although next time, it would be an idea to 
								attempt to add edge collision at least, or even a map in its entirety. The idea of also adding some more complicated AI to the game is also an intriguing idea. 
								Both features would have been added had more time been available to do so as well. </p>
								<p> In the future it would be nice to add a map as well as much more complicated AI that seek the player in a much more intelligent and believable way.
								 This may be added in the future when personal programming skills improve. More additional features such as a more complex menu system, pause system
								 and scoreboard would also be nice to add along with some aesthetically pleasing graphics also for the menus. Although the idea of making a good menu
								 system that looks good would be extremely hard for someone who isn’t very artistic... </p>
